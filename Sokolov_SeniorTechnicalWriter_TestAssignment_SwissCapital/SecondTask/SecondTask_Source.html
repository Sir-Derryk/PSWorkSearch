	<h1>Add or Edit the user</h1>
	<p>We understand that time is valuable, which is why our platform automatically adds users as soon as they register, freeing up your precious resources. But we also know that sometimes, you may want to take matters into your own hands or prevent unauthorized access.</p>
	<p>With our platform, you have the flexibility to manually register a user or restrict access to certain features for unregistered users upon their request. This ensures that you have full control over your user base and can provide the best possible experience for your customers.</p>
